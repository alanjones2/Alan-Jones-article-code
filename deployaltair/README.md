# [Your Beautiful Altair Graphics on a Simple Web Page](#)

Altair has a native method to create a web page but this is not very flexible. We expand on that with a template version to deploy Altair graphics as web pages.

### Files

- `pypage.py`is the main program where the chart and the webpage are created.
- `deployaltair.py` is a library function that generates the webpage from a template and the parameters supplied by `pypage.py`
- `bs-simple.html` is a simple HTML template
- `page.html` is the resulting webpage
